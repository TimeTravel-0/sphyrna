# sphyrna

Hammerhead Rythm Station was developed by Bram Bos in 1997 as Freeware for Win95. The original website is dead, the mail adress does not work.

This is an effort to document the used file format / provide extraction tools. Maybe a HTML5 audio rewrite will come into life. As I respect the original work and do not want to use the name without permission, this is named Sphyrna (biological name of hammerhead sharks).

The original readme included the following statement:

"HammerHead is freeware. You are allowed to copy it and use it just as much and as long as you like. If you make a copy of the software, all the original files (including the text) must be included. It is strictly prohibited to make any changes to any file, except for the demo .HH files and the .HUB files..."

So, all files are kept in original state in the "soft" subfolder. Files are not changed. If I do a HTML5, Python etc. rewrite, it will just use compatible file formats for .HH (track), .HUB (user sounds) and CUSTMGUI.dll (built-in sounds). File formats are observed by a close look at the contents and program behaviour, so no decompilation etc. happened.

As there is no way to contact the autor and according to http://www.threechords.com/hammerhead/faq.shtml he "[...] had to drop all support for HH[...]", the used samples "[...]have been floating around in the public domain for ages. Personally, I'd say you can use them - especially because they have all been used hundreds of times before[...]". The software was written ~19 Years ago and support dropped ~one year later. For now, I suspect Hammerhead Rythm Station Abandonware ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abandonware ).
